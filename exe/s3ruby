Usage: hello-s3 bucket_name [operation] [file_name]

Where:
  bucket_name (required) is the name of the bucket

  operation   is the operation to perform on the bucket:
              create  - creates a new bucket
              upload  - uploads a file to the bucket
              list    - (default) lists up to 50 bucket items

  file_name   is the name of the file to upload,
              required when operation is 'upload'
